## Description
Step back in time with the classic Snake game implemented in Python. In this nostalgic game, you control a pixelated snake that continuously grows longer as it devours apples. Navigate the snake around the screen using arrow keys, strategically collecting blue dots to increase your score and snake's length.

## Rules

Objective: The main goal of the game is to control a snake on the screen, guiding it to eat as many apples as possible while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake's own body.

Movement: The snake moves continuously in a specific direction (usually forward). The player can change its direction using arrow keys (up, down, left, and right) to guide the snake around the screen.

Apples: Apples appear randomly on the screen. The snake must "eat" these apples by running into them. Each time the snake eats an apple, its length increases by one segment.

Collision with Walls:  If the snake hits the edge of the screen, it will re-appear from the opposite end.

Collision with Self: The snake cannot pass through its own body. If the snake collides with its own body, the game ends.

Growth: As the snake eats apples, its length increases. The player must be careful not to let the snake's head collide with its own body.

Scoring: Players earn points for each apple consumed. The more apples eaten, the higher the score. The game might also incorporate a high-score system to encourage competition.

Game Over: The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or its own body. At that point, the player's final score is displayed, and they have the option to play again.

These simple rules create a dynamic and addictive gameplay experience, where players strive to improve their skills and achieve higher scores while avoiding the ever-present danger of collisions.
